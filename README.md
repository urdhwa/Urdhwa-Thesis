- [x] History of OC6
- [x] Basis to measure if a Test Case is effective
## 13/12/17-20/12/17
- [x] Analysis of Test case based on Duration
## 03/01/18-10/01/18
- [x] Clarification of Workflow and Tool Diagram
- [x] Disscussion on techniques to Optimise the CI platform
- [x] Factors to be optimised ie time and no of test cases
- [x] And how to evaluate the optimisation
## 10/01/18-17/01/18
- [x] Disscussion on implementation.
- [x] Discussion on metics for optimisation and how time to be analysed after optimisation.
## 17/01/18-24/01/18
- [x] Found new algorithm for optimisation based on past results.
- [x] Disscussed ideas based on window's size of the test cases to be considered.
## 24/01/18-02/02/18
- [x] Implemented the algorithm using excel VBA. 
- [x] Verified the result for various test cases.
- [x] The optimisation criteria is in terms of reducing the number of test cases initially and later on time also may add onto that.
## 02/02/18-08/02/18
- [x] Implementation of algorithm per component basis.
- [x] Tackling of issue, components not indicated in database using some particular field.
- [x] Implementing the algorithm using VBA.
## 02/02/18-09/02/18
- [x] Using the Gerrit IDs to make out various CIs for different component from DB.
- [x] Extracting data for each test case of these CI specially its status.
- [x] Implementing the algorithm to predict the inclusiveness of a particular test case based on history for each test case.
- [x] Define the prediction to be FP,FN,TP,TN etc.
## 09/02/18-14/02/18
- [x] Implement the algorithm using python
- [x] Analyse the impact of window sizes on fp,fn,tp,tn
- [x] Analyse the impact of window sizes on precision and accuracy.
## 14/02/18-21/02/18
- [x] Analysis of various window sizes on each continous integration or CI instead of Test case
- [x] Analysis of improvement in each CI with the usuage of the algorithm over retest-all strategy.

## 14/02/18-21/02/18
- [x] Results shown for various We and Wf sizes 
- [x] There were 100 * 100 window sizes of each Wf and We
- [x] One of the conclusion is that there is no selected set of TCs which will optimize
- [x] Importance of effectiveness
